## About

Illuminate is a tool that help you browse through a newly revealed report/commendation data that valve exposed due to EU GDPR regulation. Data in its raw form is not hard to read but might be tiresome to go through. Illuminate fill that gap by automatically fetching matches data for you. This tool is powered mainly by OpenDota API and did everything client-side. That means no data is event transferred to us and is only yours to see.

## The Script

The script and extension works by collecting data and send it to display on Illuminate webpage. It can only read what is on the page so you'll need to login and navigate to that page yourselves. After that, data is packed and you'll be redirect to Illuminate webpage. It will then fetch every match data from [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/) directly from your browser. We stored none of your report data, only visitation info (where you're from, which browser do you use, etc) using Google Analytic.
