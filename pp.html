        <h2>Full Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is DotaSphere's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, <a href="https://illuminate.dotasphere.com">https://illuminate.dotasphere.com</a>,
            and other sites we own and operate.</p>
        <h3>1. Information we collect</h3>
        <h4>Log data</h4>
        <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. It may include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the
            time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.</p>
        <h3>2. Legal bases for processing</h3>
        <p>We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.</p>
        <p>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);</li>
            <li>it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
            <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or</li>
            <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
        <p>We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure,
            copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our
            compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p>
        <h3>3. Collection and use of information</h3>
        <p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to enable you to customise or personalise your experience of our website;</li>
            <li>to enable you to access and use our website, associated applications and associated social media platforms;</li>
            <li>to contact and communicate with you;</li>
            <li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes;</li>
            <li>for analytics, market research and business development, including to operate and improve our website, associated applications and associated social media platforms;</li>
            <li>to run competitions and/or offer additional benefits to you;</li>
            <li>for advertising and marketing, including to send you promotional information about our products and services and information about third parties that we consider may be of interest to you;</li>
            <li>to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that we may have; and</li>
            <li>to consider your employment application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3>
        <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, ad networks, analytics, error
                loggers, debt collectors, maintenance or problem-solving providers, marketing or advertising providers, professional advisors and payment systems operators;
            </li>
            <li>our employees, contractors and/or related entities; and</li>
            <li>third parties to collect and process data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. International transfers of personal information</h3>
        <p>The personal information we collect is stored and processed in Singapore and Thailand, or where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal information, you
            consent to the disclosure to these overseas third parties.</p>
        <p>We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection
            clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.</p>
        <p>Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There
            are risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy
            laws.</p>
        <h3>6. Your rights and controlling your personal information</h3>
        <p><strong>Choice and consent:</strong> By providing personal information to us, you consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you are under 16 years

        <p><strong>Restrict:</strong> You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information. If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind
            at any time by contacting us using the details below. If you ask us to restrict or limit how we process your personal information, we will let you know how the restriction affects your use of our website or products and
            services.</p>
        <p><strong>Access and data portability:</strong> You may request details of the personal information that we hold about you. You may request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Where possible, we will provide this
            information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format. You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you at any time. You may also request that we transfer this personal information to another
            third party.</p>
        <p><strong>Correction:</strong> If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, please contact us using the details below. We will take reasonable steps to
            correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or out of date.</p>

            will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint. You also have the right to contact a regulatory body
            or data protection authority in relation to your complaint.</p>

        <p>We use “cookies” to collect information about you and your activity across our site. A cookie is a small piece of data that our website stores on your computer, and accesses each time you visit, so we can understand how you use

        <h3>8. Business transfers</h3>

        <p>We use cookies to help improve your experience of <a href="https://illuminate.dotasphere.com">https://illuminate.dotasphere.com</a>. This cookie policy is part of DotaSphere's privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between

        <p>If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from <a href="https://illuminate.dotasphere.com">https://illuminate.dotasphere.com</a>, with the understanding that we may be unable

        <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you
            return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
        <p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising,
            language).</p>
        <p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically only track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are
            called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>

        <p>Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins, account management, shopping carts and payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our
            website.</p>
        <h4>Performance cookies</h4>
        <p>Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without collecting personal information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across
            all site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their audience’s overall website
            experience. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance cookies on our site.</p>
        <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
        <p>Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may configure on the website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites can provide you
            with customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.</p>
        <h4>Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
        <p>Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you
            see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party
            services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. We use targeting/advertising cookies on our site.</p>
        <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites—for example, analytics providers and content partners. We grant these third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They
            may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no control over third-party
            cookies, they are not covered by DotaSphere's cookie policy.</p>
        <h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
        <p>We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before enlisting their services to ensure their practices align with ours. We will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or violate the
            privacy of our users.</p>
        <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
        <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies
            altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.</p>
        <p>If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</p>
        <p>Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.</p>
